# Section 5: Simple build distribution

[![Azure Cloud Build Section 5 Overview](media/cloud-build-pipeline/acb5-dist/acb5-roadmap.png)](media/cloud-build-pipeline/acb5-dist/acb5-roadmap.png)

We will use an Azure Blob Storage container to hold all our builds. Letâ€™s set that up now.

1.In your Azure subscription, create a Storage account

[![Storage Account](media/cloud-build-pipeline/acb5-dist/storageaccount.png)](media/cloud-build-pipeline/acb5-dist/storageaccount.png)

2. Enter your **Subscription**, **resource group**, **storage account name**, and **region**.

3. For **Performance and Redundancy**, you can leave the default choices.

4. At this point, you can click on **Review + create**, then **Create**, for the purposes of this demo. Feel free, however, to customize networking, security and other settings.

5. Once the storage account is provisioned, go to the resource.

6. Now, create a container within the new storage account. In the left settings menu, click on **Containers**, then **+Container**.

7. In the New container blade:
    - Name: Enter the name of your new container
    - Public access level: select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs)

> [!NOTE
>
> This access level is for demo purposes only. Please do not store sensitive information in this container, alternatively secure your setup with information from [here](/azure/architecture/framework/services/storage/storage-accounts/security).

8. Click **Create.**
