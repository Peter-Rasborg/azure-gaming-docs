# Setting up a STUN/TURN Server in Azure

## Overview

When deploying Unreal Pixel Streaming, some of your clients might be on networks that have settings that prevent a successful WebRTC connection. In these cases, Epic suggests using a STUN server, or a TURN server. More information can be found in the [Epic Unreal Pixel Streaming documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/SharingAndReleasing/PixelStreaming/Hosting/).

## Setting up the machine

The walkthrough assumes a deployed Ubuntu 18.04 machine in Azure. If you are looking how to deploy a Linux VM in Azure, have a look at []his quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal) on the Microsoft Docs site.

## Setting up the STUN/TURN Server

[Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is an open-source STUN/TURN Server project, with many configuration options. To deploy Coturn, please have a look at [this blogpost on OurCodeWorld](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/1175/how-to-create-and-configure-your-own-stun-turn-server-with-coturn-in-ubuntu-18-04) that perfectly describes the process.

## DNS Option

In the walkthrough DNS is configured. In case you need a domain name, you can [register one in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/manage-custom-dns-buy-domain), and use [Azure DNS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-overview) to host the DNS for your domain.

## SSL Certificate Option

There are many ways to obtain an SSL certificate. An easy and cheap way is to use LetsEncrypt. Since the Coturn server does not have port 80 available, a manual request with a DNS challenge is easiest:

1. Install CertBot

```bash
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

2. Request the certificate

```bash
sudo certbot -d *.yourdomain.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly
```

Follow the steps certbot is guiding you through.

3. Update the Coturn configuration to point to your newly created certificates and restart the service:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/turnserver.conf
sudo systemctl restart coturn
```

## Opening network ports

Depending on what you configure, youâ€™ll need to open some network ports for the STUN and/or TURN Server to be reachable. For TLS the default port is 5349, and it needs to be open for UDP and TCP. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Azure Portal** at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Go to the **Resource Group** that contains your STUN/TURN Server deployment
3. Select the **Network Security Group**
4. Click **Inbound security rules** on the left
5. Click **+ Add** on the top of the new blade
6. Use the following settings:
    1. Source: Any
    2. Source port ranges: *
    3. Destination: Any
    4. Service: Custom
    5. Destination port ranges: 5349
    6. Protocol: Any
    7. Action: Allow
    8. Priority: Lower than 65000
    9. Name: A descriptive name like Stun-Turn-Port
7. Click **Add** to save the rule

After this your STUN and TURN Server is up and running.
