# Section 7: Testing

1.	On the developer workstation, open a browser to your Azure DevOps project, navigate to your Pipelines.

2.	In Unreal Editor, open the ShooterGame project and make a change, like add an object into the scene. Test the game in the Editor to make sure it runs fine.

3.	Check in the change either directly in Unreal Editor or in p4v.

4.	Refresh the browser showing your Azure DevOps pipelines. Your pipeline build should show as starting up.

5.	Wait for the build to be completed, archived and copied.

6.	On your developer workstation, open Azure Storage Explorer. Sign in to your subscription and navigate to the storage container.

7.	Download the build zip file to your dev workstation.

8.	Unzip the build file, and click on ShooterGame.exe to run the game.

9.	Verify your previous changes are in the build.
