# GitHub and Git Tools on the Game Development Virtual Machine

Using source control solutions like Git and GitHub are essential so that teams can collaboratively work on game development.

## Git tools

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a commonly used distributed version control solution in the developer community. This Game Development Virtual Machine comes with the complete Git toolset installed, including Git Bash, Git CMD and the Git GUI client. It also includes the [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) extension which is perfect for versioning large files for game development.

## Manage repositories with GitHub

The Game Development Virtual Machine comes with Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio Code pre-installed too. Both easily provide tooling to easily integrate with Git and GitHub, so you can clone your favorite GitHub repository using your most familiar method right away, without spending time to configure the infrastructure.

And Visual Studio Code comes with the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github), which allows you to review and manage pull requests and issues seamlessly.

## Next steps

For more information about how to use and manage the GitHub repositories, please visit the [GitHub Docs page on managing repositories](https://docs.github.com/repositories).
