# Quickstart: Remoting into the Game Development Virtual Machine with Parsec

Access the Azure Game Development Virtual Machine using Parsec. Parsec is a high-performance remote access technology built for the Media & Entertainment industry. It provides high fidelity and low latency remote access experience. Parsec’s agent is pre-installed on the VM and requires a [Parsec client](https://parsec.app/downloads) to connect to the VM.

## Prerequisites

Check with your Parsec team administrator to ensure that there is an Azure Game Development Virtual Machine matched to your Parsec account in the Parsec admin panel. Usually, your team administrator invites you through the Parsec team’s dashboard. And you create your own account. For more information, please read [Parsec for Teams Onboarding Guide](https://pages.parsec.app/hubfs/AWS%20AMI%20marketplace/Parsec%20for%20Teams%20Onboarding%20Guide.pdf).
